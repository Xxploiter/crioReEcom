Read this before accessing the services 

The IMP Factory Method pattern is used for accessing services. In this pattern,you can create
 a Factory class responsible
 for creating instances of different classes, including the RetailerService class. 
 The load_service method in the controller can then be modified to use the Factory class 
 to create an instance of the RetailerService class. This would improve the maintainability 
 of the code and make it easier to add additional services in the future.

IMP{when creating a file inside the services directory name should be all lowercase except
the factory class(serviceFactory which is already named)}

IMP{inside the factory class when using the switch case/ adding another service here make sure
the name is in lowercase and the class's name is in StudlyCaps(ex: return new RetailerService();)
the class name should also be StudlyCaps}
